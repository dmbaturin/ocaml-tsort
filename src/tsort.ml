(* The Kahn's algorithm:
    1. Find nodes that have no dependencies ("isolated") and remove them from the graph hash.
       Add them to the initial sorted nodes list and the list of isolated nodes for the
       first sorting pass.
    2. For every isolated node, walk through the remaining nodes and
       remove it from their dependency list.
       Nodes that only depended on it now have empty dependency lists.
    3. Find all nodes with empty dependency lists and append them to the sorted
       nodes list _and_ the list of isolated nodes to use for the next step
    4. Repeat until the list of isolated nodes is empty
    5. If the graph hash is still not empty, it means there is a cycle.
